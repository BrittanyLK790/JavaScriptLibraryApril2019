<!--Introduced in HTML5, the SECTION tag is helpful in allowing us to avoid 'divitis'. Having a variety of ways to seperate our code is useful, but the real advantage is that content inside <section> is grouped to indicate by a heading (<h1>-<h6>) as a nested or CHILD element. This contrasts with <div> where the elements contained within it are only related by being children of the <div> and by ATTRIBUTES assigned to the <div>.-->

<!--This is another example of intentional programming in that an unaware, or apathetic, developer may sling <div> tags around with no recognition for the superior accessibility to screen readers and easier maintainability for authors that <section> offers.-->

<!--Extra Reading, is an excellent resource from the team that defines the standards that the internet operates by. Start getting into the habit of looking for information from first-party sources and the authors of the technology that we all use.-->
