<!--The inline frame (iframe) is used to embed another document inside of an HTML document. This is a fairly straight-forward way to describe the <iframe>, and that is because it is a fairly straight-forward element to use in practice. Embedding third-party media is a common use of <iframe> and we'll show you how to insert a YouTube video into your HTML using this tag.-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>iframe</title>
</head>
<body>

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/owsfdh4gxyc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</body>
</html>

<!--It may seem strange that this isn't a void element, similar to the <img /> tag, but that is explained readily enough: compatibillity with legacy versions of web browsers. If you've already tried to insert text between the opening/closing tags, you probably noticed that the test doesn't appear when the document is rendered. This is because the browser simply ignores that content. <iframe> can be styled, as we have done above with the WIDTH an HEIGHT attributes. However, you'll want to consider how your styling may be rendered on a variety of devices.-->
