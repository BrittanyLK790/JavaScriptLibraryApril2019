<!--Self-Closing Tags, Here are a few tags for organizing concepts. They are not as common, but useful to know. They also can teach us about self-closing tags. Self-closing tags only hve one tag involved. They are open and closed. We can write like this: <hr /> or <hr>.
hr Stands for HORIZONTAL rule: Used to seperate content. Provides a horizontal line between items.
br IS simply a line BREAK: seperates content using white space instead of a line.(We used one here, to prevent the sentence about br from wrapping up to the line above!)-->

<!--First Example, we're referencing a location inside our project using relative pathing in the SRC attribute. In this case, we back up one step (../) in the directory tree and then dive into our ../4-assets; and then point directly at the image we want to be displayed (/TurnForTheWorse.jpg). The entire path that you type out should look like this: ../4-assets/TurnForTheWorst.jpg.
In other Examples, we've nested <img> tags inside of <a> tags so that the images themselves act as links. The final Example uses the CLASS attribute and the <style tag to display our picture as a circle.-->
