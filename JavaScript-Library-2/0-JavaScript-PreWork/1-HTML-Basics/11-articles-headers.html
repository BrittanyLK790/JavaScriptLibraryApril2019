<!--So, in the description we quoted it was stated that <article> is used for any "independent item of content". What does that mean? Basically, if you're able to strip away all of the content from around the <article>Content</article> and it still makes sense, then it might belong in an <article>!-->

<!--We're introducing <header> in this same lesson because these two elements are frequently seen together. You'll see this pattern because stand-alone content (like an article, right?) tends to need ways to identify the content for the user. Briefly, it's worth remarking that the <header> element is NOT the same as A HEADING TAG like an <h2></h2>. Much like the title to a book, <header> acts as a container for introductory content like A HEADING or a logo.-->
